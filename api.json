      "full": "The Yeti is a legendary ape-like creature purported to inhabit the Himalayan mountain range of Asia. Described as standing 6-10 feet tall, covered in reddish-brown or white fur, and adapted to high-altitude environments, the Yeti has been part of local folklore for centuries. The creature gained international attention in the early 20th century through accounts from Western mountaineers. While scientific expeditions have found no conclusive evidence, the Yeti remains deeply embedded in Himalayan culture and continues to fascinate cryptozoologists worldwide."
