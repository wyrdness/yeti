      "full": "The Yeti, also known as the Abominable Snowman, is a legendary ape-like creature purported to inhabit the Himalayan mountain range of Asia. Described as standing 6-10 feet tall, covered in reddish-brown or white fur, and adapted to high-altitude environments, the Yeti has been part of local folklore for centuries. The phenomenon gained international attention in the early 20th century through accounts from Western mountaineers exploring the world's highest peaks. While scientific expeditions have found no conclusive evidence, the Yeti remains deeply embedded in Himalayan culture and continues to fascinate cryptozoologists worldwide. The Yeti represents one of the most iconic cryptid phenomena globally, with approximately 200 documented sightings, deep roots in Tibetan Buddhist and Sherpa traditions, and continued cultural significance throughout the Himalayan region. Recent DNA analysis has identified many \\\"Yeti\\\" samples as coming from rare Himalayan bear species, though debate continues."
